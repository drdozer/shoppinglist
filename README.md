Example lagom application for managing shopping lists

I've been writing this app to learn lagom, and to see if I get on with it well enough to commit to building real things in it.
As it's my first lagom project, it probably does some things a little bit strangely.
The hope is that it ends up as a micro-service back-end with web, android and ios front-ends.
